1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

  Artemis Financial is a financial company that helps clients with their insurance, savings, investments and retirement. Artemis wanted to update their software to the latest security measures; thus, Artemis will be able to keep their client's information safe.  
  
  
2. What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

  One thing I thought I did well on was introducing an algorithm cipher to prevent data being stolen. It is important to code securely because it keeps our system safe and prevent leaks/attacks on our system. Knowing that our software is secure gives the company and their clients peace at mind knowing their data will not be breeched. This will keep customers trust in Artemis. 
  

3. What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

  I think that the dependency check report is a huge help with showing where our system is vulnerable. 


4. How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

  The first approach I took to increase layers of security was making sure our system and third party tools were up to date. This is essential because it keeps the software running properly. Adding an algorithm cipher and a generating a certificate went a long way in adding security. Lastly, I used static testing to help me along the way. 


5. How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  To start the process, we will frequently test the code to make sure that the code was running properly. We added a dependency check to ensure vulnerabilities are addressed. After the code was refactored, we ran the check again to check if there was any new vulnerabilities. 
  

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  Like I said in the beginning, the dependency check is a crucial tool in preventing vulnerabilities. It is helpful in know how to read the report and see if it a false positive or a issue that needs to be addressed. 
  

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

  My algorithm cipher implementation was successful and effective. I would show this assignment off.
